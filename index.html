                    <p>Virat Kohli born 5 November 1988 is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India
                        national team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best
                        contemporary batsmen in the world.He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and for Royal
                        Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as captain of the franchise since 2013.
                    </p>
                    <p>Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a
                        few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially
                        having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular
                        in the ODI middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test
                        debut in 2011 and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in
                        Australia and South Africa.[4] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI
                        batsmen for the first time in 2013,[5] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 for mat, winning
                        the Man of the Tournament twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).</p>
                    <p>Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and handed over the Test captaincy
                        following Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Test retirement in 2014. In early 2017, he became the
                        limited-overs captain as well after Dhoni stepped down from the position. In ODIs, Kohli has the
                        second highest number of centuries and the highest number of centuries in run-chases in the
                        world. He holds the world record for being the fastest batsman to 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 11,000
                        and 12,000 runs in ODI cricket. Among Indian batsmen, Kohli has the best ever Test rating (937
                        points), ODI rating (911 points) and T20I rating (897 points).</p>
